                In the summer of 2021, rock climbing finally made it's first ever appearance at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games in Japan's Aomi Urban Sports Park, giving the athletes and the climbing community the opportunity to share their sport with the world. The event fell under the title Sport Climbing and included the three main disciplines; Bouldering, Lead Climbing and Speed Climbing.

            <h3>Sport Climbing Rules and scoring</h3>
            <hr>
            <section>
                <h4>Rules:</h4>
                <p>
                    Sport climbing follows the same basic rules as casual climbing in each of the three disciplines, but also including specific competition rules for the athletes and routes. 
                </p>
                <p> Bouldering: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wall height: 4.5 meters</li>
                    <li>Time limit: 4 minutes</li>
                    <li>Attempt limit: none</li>
                    <li>Inspection time: 2 minutes per boulder problem</li>
                    <li>Isolation: yes</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Lead Climbing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wall height: 15 meters</li>
                    <li>Time limit: 6 minutes</li>
                    <li>Attempt limit: 1</li>
                    <li>Inspection time: 6 minutes</li>
                    <li>Isolation: yes</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Speed Climbing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wall height: 15 meters</li>

                <h4>Scoring:</h4>
                <h5>Overall score</h5>
                <p>
                    All the athletes must compete in each of the three disciplines; Speed Climbing followed by Bouldering followed by Lead Climbing. At the end of each stage of teh competition, their overall score is calculated by multiplying the ranks they achieve in each discipline. 
                    <br>
                    <strong>Overall Score = Speed Climbing Rank * Bouldering Rank * Lead Climbing Rank. </strong>
                </p>
                <h5>Speed Climbing</h5>
                <p>
                    This first event consists of a single route, which always has the same layout. The athletes are put in a one on one race to reach the top of the wall and stop the timer in the shortest time. Those who win their race, race against the other winners in knock out round style until each climber is ranked 1st to last based on their number of wins.
                </p>
                <h5>Bouldering</h5>
                <p>
                    This second event consists of three different boulder problems, with all the athletes attempting the first problem, one at a time, before moving onto the second and finally the third. At the end of the three problems, the athletes are ranked 1st to last place based on the number of Zones and Tops they have achieved. Where two athletes tie, their number of attempts to reach the Zones and Tops are examined to determine who takes the higher place. 
                </p>
                <h5>Lead Climbing</h5>
                <p>
                    This final event consists of a single route with it's holds numbered from 1 upwards to the Top hold. The athletes have one attempt to reach the Top hold or the highest hold they can, whilst clipping their rope into each quick-draw along the route and are ranked 1st to last place based on the number of the hold they reach. To be awarded with the hold, the climber must be in a controlled position while holding it and if the climber makes an reasonable but unsuccessful attempt towards the next hold, they are given a + after their number. This means that for two athletes who reach the same hold, if one of them had the + they would rank higher and if there is still a tie, then the climber who reached the hold in the shortest time wuld rank higher.
