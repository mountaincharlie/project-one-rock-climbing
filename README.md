# Indoor Rock Climbing

Indoor Rock Climbing is a website to introduce the three main disciplines of competition climbing; Bouldering, Lead Climbing and Speed Climbing, to anyone, from those who have only just heard of the sport to those eager to give it a go. Many people will have discovered the sport for the first time when it made it's debut Olympic appearance at Tokyo 2020. Whilst the climbs were impressive to witness, for most people, the air of mystery around the sport may have prevented them from thinking they could ever try it out for themselves. 

This site provides an insight into the rules, equipment and technical language involved in each of these three disciplines, designed to bring indoor rock climbing to anyone with an interest in the sport, as well as a brief look at its origins and some highlights from it's first Olympic appearance.

## Responsiveness [**to complete**]
---

(note: using % heights/widths in CSS contribute to responsiveness)
* media queries 
* different screen sizes
* incl. screeenshots

## UXD [**to complete**]
---
Done:
* Used Google Fonts [add-link] to choose a main font which I liked the look of (Montserrat - Extra-light 200) and one that was recommended to pair with it (Roboto - Light 300) and imported them into my styles.css so that all of my html files with the style.css link can access these fonts. I later removed the pre-set weighting from the import link so that I would have more flexibilty with styling the font.
* Used Google Fonts [add-link] to choose Fira Sans to pair with Montserrat and imported all the none-italicised weights so that I had the flexibility to see which are most readable in different page sections.  
* Homepage background image:
    * Originally was a more close up image that was a bit dark and only a few colours.
    * Changed to the current image which is a lot lighter and even though there are a few more colours, I feel that no part of the image particularly draws the user's attention away from the main text and navigation.
    * I used the linear-gradient CSS property to create a semi-transparent layer over the image in order to make the text and navigation ontop stand out a bit more.
    * I tried using tinyPNG [add-link] and tinyJPEG [add-link] to reduce the size of the image, but when testing the reduced images I did feel that the quality of the image suffered a bit on larger screens so I decided to keep the full size image which is less than 500kb anyway. 
* Colour scheme: while experimenting with what colours looked nice with my homepage background image, I found that the dark blue #2F4858 worked well and used <a href = "https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23845EC2&sub=1">ColorSpace</a> to find some other colours which worked with it. I ended up choosing from the reccomended Natural Palette; bright blue #00A0F3 and off-white #F1FBFF as nice complements to use throughout my pages' different features and highlihighlightsgths.
* Adding the CSS transition-duration and transition-timing-function properties to make some of the hover effects smoother and a better experience for the user.

### Styling ...
* colour
* fonts
* icons (continuity)
* consistent page structure for the 3 info pages and same footer across all and same header for all bu the homepage, but the homepage main logo matches the one on the header LHS.

### Interactivity ...
* info-tiles
* social media
* form (ask/suggest/hear)
* hover highlight effects
* hover main-nav effect
* CSS transition-duration and transition-timing-function properties
* no autoplay on the video

## Accessability [**to complete**]
---

Done: 
* Added aria-labels to the footer social media links (read about on: <a href = "https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA8.html">Using aria-label for link purpose</a>)
* Added the alt attribute to the img element for social media icons for better accessibility for screen readers and so that some text will be displayed if the image fails to load for some reason.
* Changed homepage navigation buttons into anchor element links after researching which would be best from an accessability point of view. The <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmoCfODeBTA">Stop Using Buttons as Links</a> Youtube video by Steve Griffith explains how the button and anchor elements can be styled to look identical and work the same with other languages such as JavaScript, but there is actually more inbuilt accessability with anchor elements, if you are using it for the purpose of linking to another part of the page or openeing a new page, such as opening in new tabs/incognito tabs/windows.
* Added the main element around the main content of each page (except for the homepage whose main content is the nav element which cannot be placed inside the main element) for better screen reader accessability.
* Used the <a href = "https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/HTML/wiki/RoleAttribute">RoleAttribute</a> W3 webpage to learn about the role attribute and some of the values it can have for elements which don't have specific semantic value. So in order to increase the accessability of my website I added:
    * The role = "note" attribute to my Safety First message on my The Three Main Climbign Disciplines page and on the background page paragraph which prompts the user to get in contact if they think I've missed something on the site. This was because these paragraphs were designed to act more as 'side notes' to the main content.
    * The role = "navigation" to the div elements in my footer, which I needed to use in order to float the lists of links to the left and right of the footer, along with the aria-label = "Footer links to contact form or site credits" (for the left div) and aria-label = "Footer links to social media pages" (for the right div).
    * A div around the list of viewport fixed links I have fixed to the lower right hand side so that I could use the role = "navigation" aria-label = "Links to page top or homepage" attributes.
* Used the <a href = "https://www.digitala11y.com/definition-role/">WAI-ARIA: Role=Definition</a> Digital A11Y webpage to learn how the role = "definition" attribute can be used the aria-labelledby attribute for definitions, so I applied this to my info-tiles in my Background and The Three Main Climbing Disciplines pages by:

```
<div aria-labelledby = "term-id">
    <h5 id = "term-id">'term title'</h5>
    <p role = "definition" aria-labelledby = "term-id">
        'definition wording'
    </p>
</div>
```

## Other Feature Ideas [**to complete**]
---

Some other feature ideas, which I didn't have time to implement.

### Fixed navigation links:
Like the 3 icon links for the Bouldering, Lead Climbing and Speed sections on my The Three Main Climbing Disciplines page, it would be nice to add these extra navigation features on the Background and As Seen At Tokyo 2020 pages. 

### Icons for the TOP and HOME links:
To give some more uniformity with the icons on my The Three Main Climbing Disciplines page, it would be nice to replace the TOP and HOME fixed-links with icons like an up arrow for TOP and a house for HOME.

### Images for the equipment required:
Having pictures of the equipment such as the climbing shoes and harnesses could help users who haven't seen the equipment make sense of it more in their head. 

### Videos for the equipment required: 
Videos could be used to demonstrate how to use the climbing equipment and/or to show some best practices in rock climbing.

### Paraclimbing page:
Include a page about paraclimbers; more information on accessability for different people in climbing, about casual and competative paraclimbing and the possibility of it making an apperance in a later Paraolympics.

## Testing [**to complete**]
---

### HTML & CSS validator warnings and fixes:
* [19-10-21] 1st testing index.html in WC3 markup validator indicated:
    * that I had section elements without headings, which led me to create the welcome h2 heading for the #welcome-para section and to realise that my main-nav nav element did not need to be within a section element.
    * that I had anchor elements within button elements, which led me to research buttons vs anchor elements from an accessability point of view and to ulitmately change the buttons to just be anchor element links (as explained in the Accessability section).
* [29-10-21] tested my background.html file after adding role = "section" to the divs of my info-tiles, but this came back as a bad request and checking the <a href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/roles/section_role">Aria: Section Role</a> page on MDN Web Docs highlighted to me that role = "section" shouldn't be used, so I used the aria-labelledby attribute as explained in the Accessability section.

### Bugs and Fixes:
* [21-10-21] couldn't get the font-weight property to work for my Monserrat and Roboto Google Fonts. 
    * Solution: After searching through the Google Fonts site I realised I needed to import all of the font weights that I wanted to use in my website, so I imported a number that I wanted to try.  
* [24-10-21] on larger screens some of my pages which didn't have a lot of content ment that the footer was not at the bottom of the viewport. 
    * Solution: I created a CSS class with min-height = 100vh and applied it to the main element of each page (nav element for the homepage) so that the main content of each page adapts to have a minimum height which allows it to fill the viewport on any screen size.
* [24-10-21] I had been using some styled div elements as 'buffers' for all the pages which have the fixed header, so that the header wouldn't cover content when it shouldn't. But this was a bit messy and more of a 'hack'.
    * Solution: I learnt from Abbey Fitzgerald's article on <a href = "https://getflywheel.com/layout/create-sticky-website-header-how-to/">How to create a sticky website header</a> that I could adjust the body of the page with the css property padding-top with a value equal to the height of the fixed header.
* [29-10-21] after running Lighthouse in Google Dev Tools, it warned that the fixed-link words in blue did't have an appropriate contrast to the white background.
    * Solution: so I changed these to be the same colour as the icons (#2f4858) 


### Unfixed bugs
