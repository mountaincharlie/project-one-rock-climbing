# Indoor Rock Climbing

Indoor Rock Climbing is a website to introduce the three main disciplines of competition climbing; Bouldering, Lead Climbing and Speed Climbing, to anyone, from those who have only just heard of the sport to those eager to give it a go. Many people will have discovered the sport for the first time when it made it's debut Olympic appearance at Tokyo 2020. Whilst the climbs were impressive to witness, for most people, the air of mystery around the sport may have prevented them from thinking they could ever try it out for themselves. 

This site provides an insight into the rules, equipment and technical language involved in each of these three disciplines, designed to bring indoor rock climbing to anyone with an interest in the sport, as well as a brief look at its origins and some highlights from it's first Olympic appearance.
