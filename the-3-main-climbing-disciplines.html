                Indoor bouldering is one of the easiest and most accessable forms of climbing for new climbers

                some explanation text about the colours and grades
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Identify the starting hand holds. These are often indicated either by coloured tape or a little metal tag with an <strong>S</strong> on it and/or the grade of the climb. [varies from gym to gym]</li>
                <li>Identify the starting feet holds. These may be marked similarly to the starting hand holds. If none are marked, then it is up to you where you place your feet to start the climb.</li>
                <li>To start the climb, you must not have any part of your body on the gym matting or be holding anything other than the marked start holds [unless the climb requires a sit-start [add-link]]. It's good form to be stable in this position for at least a second or two but this isn't a strict rule in casual climbing.</li>
                <li>Make your way up the wall towards the heighest hold that is part of your route [add-link] or up to the top of the wall if it is a Top-Out [add-link] wall. You may only use; the holds which are part of your route, volumes [add-link] and any wall surfaces/edges which are allowed as part of your route [this will be specified by the gym]. </li>
                <li>Finish with both of your hands on the final hold in a controlled/stable position [in casual climbing this is down to your own judgement] or climb onto the top of the wall if it is a Top-Out wall. </li>
