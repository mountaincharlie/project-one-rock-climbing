                    <p>
                        Indoor Bouldering is probably the most accessible form of indoor rock climbing for new climbers as it requires the least amount of specific equipment and safety training. Most notciable as the climbing discipline which doesn't require the use of a rope, Bouldering routes/problems tend to be shorter climbs with a focus on being more of a physical puzzle for the climber to solve.

                        Indoor Lead Climbing is generally only performed by more experienced climbers as it requires special equipment and safety training as well as a high level of physcial endurance and familiarity with rock climbing techniques. There are, however, a couple of more accessible forms of roped rock climbing for newer climbers, namely; Top Rope and Auto-belay. Whilst Lead Climbing routes can still have elements of the physical problem solving found in Bouldering, the routes generally have more of a focus on challenging the climber's physical and mental endurance.

                        Indoor Speed Climbing is probably the least accessible of the three main disciplines, to new climbers, as it requires a very specific combination of physical strength, agility and familiarity with rock climbing techniques. The physical setup of the route is characterised by the sole use of only two shapes of climbing hold; small, round footholds and large, X-shaped hand holds, and the large timer display at the top of the wall, which is started by releasing the pressure pad at the foot of the route and stopped by hitting the pressure pad at the top of the route. Another very distinct difference in Speed Climbing from the other disciplines is that the route is always the same, having more of a focus on the climber's speed and ability to ascend the route as efficiently as possible.

                            Can be owned by the climber or rented from a climbing gym. Designed to fit tightly around the climber's foot to increase the precision and control of their foot placements.

                        <li>Identify the starting hand holds. These are the two lowest X shaped holds on the right-hand side of the wall. </li>
                        <li>Identify the starting feet positions. One foot must be placed on the timer pressure pad on the floor below the starting hand holds and the other placed on the lowest foothold. </li>
                        <li>You must wait until signalled to start the climb, as releasing your foot from the pressure pad too soon will result in a false start and immediate disqualification, which is not necessarily applicable for casual climbing. </li>
                        <li>Make your way up the wall as quickly as possible towards the timer stop pressure pad, using whichever of the holds you wish. </li>
                        <li>Finish by hitting the timer stop pressure pad, which will leave the timer displaying your climb time. If you are racing another climber, the shortest time wins.</li>
                        <li>After hitting the pressure pad and letting go of the wall, the autobelay system that you are attached to will slow your descent back down to the ground. </li>
