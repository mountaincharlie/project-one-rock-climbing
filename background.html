            <h3>Climbing Terminology</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                There is speific terminology covering all areas of the sport and as newer climbers interect with other members of the community they will become familiarised with more and more.
                Note: Due to the creative and social aspects of rock climbing, many climbers and climbing communities develop their own slang/shorthand for various techniques, pieces of equipment, styles of climbing hold etc... Here we will have a look at some of the most common climbing terminology/slang, hopefully to remove some of the mystery of the sport and to allow those newer to climbing to better understand the sport and the community.

                <h4>Climbing holds:</h4>
                <p>
                    Typically comprised of a plastic material known as polyurethane, textured with a fine silica sand and bolted onto a climbing wall [add link]. Holds can also be made of real rock or even wood and be shaped to simulate real outdoor rock surfaces or just to provide an interesting route [add link] for the climber. 
                    <br>
                    Click the tiles below to find out about the most common types of climbing hold:     
                </p>
                <div>
                    <h5>Jugs</h5>
                    <p>
                        Have a large indentation in the top of the hold with space for most, if not all, of the climber's fingers and sometimes both hands.
                        On average these holds are bigger, making them easier to grip and giving the climber more options for how to hold them.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>Footholds</h5>
                    <p>
                        Generally aren't seen very high up on the wall and are noticeably smaller in size.
                        These are more specifically intended to be used by the climber's foot, but whether a hold should be used with a hand or foot depends on the climber's technique and how the climb has been set. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>Crimps</h5>
                    <p>
                        Have a very shallow, flat surface, leaving only enough space for the pads of the climber's fingers. These vary in width, allowing anything from both hands to only a few fingers.
                        Usually only seen at harder grades due to the crimping technique[link] required to use them properly.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>Pinches</h5>
                    <p>
                        Are designed to be held by the tension between the climber's thumb on one side of the hold and their fingers on the other. This intended grip position generally gives the holds a more rectangular appearance. 
                        They're more common at difficult grades due to the hand strength required to hold them. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>Slopers</h5>
                    <p>
                        Have a smoother appearance due to their lack of significant indents or edges.
                        Climber's rely heavily on the frictional force between their hand(s) and the hold in order to use it, requiring the climber to position their hand(s) with maximum contact on the hold and their center of mass as directly below it as possible.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>Pockets</h5>
                    <p>
                        Have a small pocket cut into the face of them, generally intended to be used with 2 or 3 fingers.
                        The internal shape of the pocket can vary interms of how deep it is as well as the degree it is 'cut-in', allowing the climber to grip it as if it were a mini jug, sloper or crimp.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>Sidepulls</h5>
                    <p>
                        Generally have a similar appearance to jugs, but are orientated so that the climber grips them from the side of the hold rather than the top. To make best use of the hold, climbers idealy keep their center of mass on the opposite side of the hold. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>Undercling</h5>
                    <p>
                        Generally have a similar appearance to jugs, but are orientated so that the climber grips them from underneath the hold rather than the top. To make best use of the hold, climbers idealy keep their center of mass above or inline with the hold.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>Volumes</h5>
                    <p>
                        Are generally large shapes, composed of flat sides, giving them a geometric apperance.
                        They're primarily used to change the structure of the climbing wall to create interesting features for climbing holds to be fixed to, but climbers can use them in any way they wish, as part of any climb they're close enough to.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>Dual Texture</h5>
                    <p>
                        Refers to holds whose surfaces have two distinct textures, generally; a rough texture, like normal holds, and a very smooth finish, which provides little to, no friction. This combination is designed to narrow the climber's options as to how they can use hold.

                <h4>Types of climbing wall:</h4>
                <p>
                    In addition to the holds in climbing, the angles, features and even textures of the walls themselves contribute to the challenge of the climb. A climb may include sections fo wall that cover more than one of the types below, but a wall will predominantly fall into one of these catagories.     
                    <br>
                    Click the tiles below to find out about the most common types of climbing walls:     
                </p>
                <div>
                    <h5>Vertical Faces</h5>
                    <p>
                        Are the simplest and probably most common type of wall, not having any particular gradient or obvious features. It's common for these to have volumes and/or large climbing holds fixed to them inorder to give variety to their structure.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>Overhangs</h5>
                    <p>
                        Are angled towards the ground so that the climber has to work harder against gravity to keep their center of mass close to the wall. These are generally seen at harder grades as they require the climber to maintain a higher level of body tension, control and precision. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>Slabs</h5>
                    <p>
                        Are angled slightly away from the ground. Climbs on these sections of wall generally include holds which are more spread apart, shallower or harder to grip in some way, causing the climber to rely on their sense of balance and making slower, more accurate movements rather than very powerful or dynamic ones.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>Arêtes</h5>
                    <p>
                        Are prominent edges on a wall, generally the positive corner created where two walls meet. Some walls may have a line painted down their edge to indicate whether or not the arête is allowed to be used as part of a climb on the wall.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>Top Outs</h5>
                    <p>
                        Have some kind of platform/flat surface on top, which the climber is required to get onto in order to complete the climb, rather than just holding the final hold with both hands.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>Traverses</h5>
                    <p>
                        Are set so that the climber moves predominantly in a horizontal direction rather than vertically. Traverse walls are generally used for warm up/cool down exercises or for training, but any climb could have a section of it that falls into this definition.  
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>Top Ropes</h5>
                    <p>
                        Have a rope running through a fixture at the top of a high wall, with both ends hanging down. One end of the rope is intended for the climber's harness and the other end is for their belayer's harness. The belayer takes in the slack in the rope as the climber ascends.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>Autobelays</h5>
                    <p>
                        Have a rope fixed at the top of a high wall, in an autobelay system, with one end of rope hanging down for the climber to clip to their harness. As the climber ascends, the system automatically draws in the slack in the rope and if the climber lets go of the wall completely, it slows their descent.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>Leads</h5>
                    <p>
                        Have a number of quickdraw fixtures spaced throughout a climb on a high wall. The climber has one end of a rope attached to their harness and the other is attached to their belayer's, who is responsible for maintaining the correct amount slack in the rope as the climber ascends, clipping their rope into the quickdraws as they pass them.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>Quickdraws</h5>
                    <p>
                        Consist of two large metal clips attached by a short rope sling. One clip has a solid gate so it cannot be easily opened, making it more secure and the end which is fixed/clipped to the climbing wall. The other clip has a bent, wire gate which is easier to open and used by Lead climbers to attach their rope to as they ascend.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>Routes/Problems</h5>
                    <p>
                        Consist of a series of climbing holds/volumes starting at one point on the wall and ending at another. The holds are generally all the same colour, which helps the climber identify the route, and it will have a particular grade/grade range to indicate its difficulty level. Generally 'problems' are used to rfer to climbs in Bouldering and 'routes' refer to longer, roped climbs.

                <h4>Climbing Technique:</h4>
                <p>
                    Whilst climbers aren't required to use any specific techniques in order to complete a climb, there are a number of 'moves', or techniques, which are so frequently use that they have earned their own place in climbing terminology.   
                    <br>
                    [MINI DISCLAIMER THING] 
                    <br>
                    Click the tiles below to find out about the most common climbing techniques:     
                </p>
                <div>
                    <h5>Matching</h5>
                    <p>
                        Is when the climber brings their second hand to the same hold or edge as their first, using it with boths hands. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>Bumping</h5>
                    <p>
                        Is when the climber moves the same hand between holds twice or more in a row, instead of using their left and right hands alternatingly. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>Crossing over</h5>
                    <p>
                        Is when the climber reaches one hand/foot across their body and past their other hand/foot in order to move to the next hold.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>Crimping</h5>
                    <p>
                        Is when the climber uses only part or all of the pads of their fingers to grip a hold or edge.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>Campusing</h5>
                    <p>
                        Is when a climber climbs without using their feet, for part or all of a climb. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>Dynoing</h5>
                    <p>
                        Is when a climber makes a dynamic moves, generally some kind of jump or large shift in body weight, inorder to reach a hold(s) which couldn't be reached statically. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>Cutting loose</h5>
                    <p>
                        Is when a climber takes their feet off the wall either inorder to progress to the next hold or as a result of a dynamic move. This is not the same as campusing, but a climber may campus part of the climb after cutting loose.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>Locking Off</h5>
                    <p>
                        Is when a climber maintains tension in a fully bent arm, while letting go with their other hand to move towards the next hold.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>Gastons</h5>
                    <p>
                        Are when the climber uses the tension of pressing away from their body in opposite directions to stabalize themself. The opposite of Compressions.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>Compressions</h5>

                    Not all climbers climb competitively, but those who don't generally love to watch those who do! It can be incredible to witness some of the very best climbers in action, but understanding the technical language used by commentators and other members of the community could provide a smoother experience for those newer to the sport.
