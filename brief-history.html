        <h3>Climbing Terminology Tiles</h3>
        <hr>

        <p>Note: Due to the creative and social aspects of rock climbing, many climbers and climbing communities develop their own slang/shorthand for various techniques, pieces of equipment, styles of climbing hold etc... Here we will have a look at some of the most common climbing terminology/slang, hopefully to remove some of the mystery of the sport and to allow those newer to climbing to better understand the sport and the community.</p>

            <h4>Climbing holds:</h4>
            <p>
                Typically comprised of a plastic material known as polyurethane, textured with a fine silica sand and bolted onto a climbing wall [add link]. Holds can also be made of real rock or even wood and be shaped to simulate real outdoor rock surfaces or just to provide an interesting route [add link] for the climber. 
                <br>
                Click the tiles below to find out about the most common types of climbing hold:     
            </p>
            <div>
                <h5>Jugs</h5>
                <p>
                    Have a large indentation in the top of the hold with space for most, if not all, of the climber's fingers and sometimes both hands.
                    On average these holds are bigger, making them easier to grip and giving the climber more options for how to hold them.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h5>Footholds</h5>
                <p>
                    Generally aren't seen very high up on the wall and are noticeably smaller in size.
                    These are more specifically intended to be used by the climber's foot, but whether a hold should be used with a hand or foot depends on the climber's technique and how the climb has been set. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h5>Crimps</h5>
                <p>
                    Have a very shallow, flat surface, leaving only enough space for the pads of the climber's fingers. These vary in width, allowing anything from both hands to only a few fingers.
                    Usually only seen at harder grades due to the crimping technique[link] required to use them properly.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h5>Pinches</h5>
                <p>
                    Are designed to be held by the tension between the climber's thumb on one side of the hold and their fingers on the other. This intended grip position generally gives the holds a more rectangular appearance. 
                    They're more common at difficult grades due to the hand strength required to hold them. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h5>Slopers</h5>
                <p>
                    Have a smoother appearance due to their lack of significant indents or edges.
                    Climber's rely heavily on the frictional force between their hand(s) and the hold in order to use it, requiring the climber to position their hand(s) with maximum contact on the hold and their center of mass as directly below it as possible.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h5>Pockets</h5>
                <p>
                    Have a small pocket cut into the face of them, generally intended to be used with 2 or 3 fingers.
                    The internal shape of the pocket can vary interms of how deep it is as well as the degree it is 'cut-in', allowing the climber to grip it as if it were a mini jug, sloper or crimp.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h5>Sidepulls</h5>
                <p>
                    Generally have a similar appearance to jugs, but are orientated so that the climber grips them from the side of the hold rather than the top. To make best use of the hold, climbers idealy keep their center of mass on the opposite side of the hold. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h5>Undercling</h5>
                <p>
                    Generally have a similar appearance to jugs, but are orientated so that the climber grips them from underneath the hold rather than the top. To make best use of the hold, climbers idealy keep their center of mass above or inline with the hold.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h5>Volumes</h5>
                <p>
                    Are generally large shapes, composed of flat sides, giving them a geometric apperance.
                    They're primarily used to change the structure of the climbing wall to create interesting features for climbing holds to be fixed to, but climbers can use them in any way they wish, as part of any climb they're close enough to.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h5>Dual Texture</h5>
                <p>
                    Refers to holds whose surfaces have two distinct textures, generally; a rough texture, like normal holds, and a very smooth finish, which provides little to, no friction. This combination is designed to narrow the climber's options as to how they can use hold.

                In addition to the holds in climbing, the angles, features and even textures of the walls themselves contribute to the challenge of the climb.

            <p>
                Whilst climbers aren't required to use any specific techniques in order to complete a climb, there are a number of 'moves', or techniques, which are so frequently use that they have earned their own place in climbing terminology.

                There is speific terminology covering all areas of the sport and as newer climbers interect with other memebers of the community they will become familiarised with more and more. In addition to the holds, walls and techniques there are a few other terms which are frequently discussed amongst climbers.
